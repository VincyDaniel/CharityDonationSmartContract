# Vince Charity Donation DApp

This project demonstrates a decentralized application (DApp) for charity donations using Ethereum blockchain technology. It includes a Solidity smart contract for managing donations and a React-based frontend for interacting with the contract.

## Description

The project consists of two main components:

### Smart Contract (VinceCharityDonation.sol)

The Solidity smart contract `VinceCharityDonation.sol` manages the following functionalities:

- **defineGoal**: Allows the contract owner to set a fundraising goal.
- **contribute**: Enables users to contribute Ether to the charity campaign.
- **extractFunds**: Allows the contract owner to withdraw collected funds after the campaign ends.

### Frontend (index.js)

The frontend is a React application (`index.js`) that interacts with the smart contract through Web3.js. It provides the following features:

- **Connect to MetaMask**: Allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet.
- **View Account Information**: Displays the user's Ethereum account and total contributions.
- **Contribute**: Enables users to contribute to the charity campaign.
- **Extract Funds**: Allows the contract owner to withdraw funds collected.
